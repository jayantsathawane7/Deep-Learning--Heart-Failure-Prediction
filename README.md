# Deep-Learning--Heart-Failure-Prediction
Data of age, anaemia, creatinine_phosphokinase, diabetes, ejection_fraction, high_blood_pressure, platelets, serum_creatinine, serum_sodium, sex, smoking, time, DEATH_EVENT. Mathematical functions are implemented and graphs are used for better understanding of specific elements.

Inshort this is Deep Learning Project where probability and accuracy of how many people died is been predict.
